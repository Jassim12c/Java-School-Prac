//1) Turn the following lines into an array of String called stanza1 using shortcut method

/*
		"Rain and tears are the same",
		"But in the sun you've got to play the game",
		"When you cry in winter time",
		"You can pretend it's nothing but the rain"
*/

//2) Turn the following lines into an array of String called stanza2 using new keyword


/*
		"Tears coming from your blue eyes",
		"How many times I've seen",
		"Rain and tears are the same",
		"But in the sun you've got to play the game"
*/

		int[] a = {5, 5, 2};
		for (int j : a) {
			System.out.println(j);
		}


//3) The first two lines of stanza2 are mixed up, write code to swap them





//4) Make an array of String called roussos whose size is the size of stanza1 and stanza2
// combined plus 2 for a title and a separating line



// 5) Fill up the array roussos using a counter and stanza1 and stanza2 arrays.
// first add the title => "Rain & Tears"
// then loop to add each line of stanza1
// then add the separating line => "--------------------------------------------"
// then loop to add each line of stanza2



// 6) Print out Demis Roussos's famous song... Rain & Tears using a loop



/*
Final output should be like this=>

Rain & Tears
Rain and tears are the same
But in the sun you've got to play the game
When you cry in winter time
You can pretend it's nothing but the rain
--------------------------------------------
How many times I've seen
Tears coming from your blue eyes
Rain and tears are the same
But in the sun you've got to play the game
